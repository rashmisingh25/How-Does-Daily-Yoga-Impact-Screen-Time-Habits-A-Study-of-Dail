The research questions answered in this project are:
Total time spent on each activity vs total screen time (Note that we didn't consider the Yoga columns since it has binary values (Did yoga that day or not) not the minutes spent on doing it)

Correlation between total screen time and daily activities.

Linear Regression  on the dataset

Perform a t-test to determine the statistical significance of the relationship

Investigate how long it takes to establish a healthy habit, such as decreased phone usage, by looking at changes in average daily screen time over the period of a month or two months before and after beginning yoga practice, adjusting for weekly period effect

The median value for screen time spent on social networking sites for people who do yoga and who do not.
